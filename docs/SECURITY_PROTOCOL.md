# ðŸ”’ Lili Nutrition App - Security Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Lili Nutrition App to protect user data, ensure application security, and maintain compliance with relevant regulations.

## Data Protection

### User Data Classification

| Data Type | Classification | Storage | Retention |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Authentication Credentials | Highly Sensitive | Encrypted | Until account deletion |
| Personal Information | Sensitive | Encrypted | Until account deletion |
| Health Information | Sensitive | Encrypted | Until account deletion |
| Meal Preferences | Moderate | Encrypted | Until account deletion |
| Usage Analytics | Low | Anonymized | 12 months |

### Encryption Standards

- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption
- **Database**: Transparent data encryption
- **API Keys**: Encrypted and rotated quarterly
- **Passwords**: Argon2id with appropriate work factors

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Methods

- **Primary**: Email/password with strong password requirements
- **MFA**: Optional Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
- **Session Management**: JWT with short expiration and secure refresh tokens
- **Password Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - Maximum age: 90 days

### Authorization Framework

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - User: Standard application access
  - Admin: Application management access
  - System: Internal service access

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**:
  - Users can only access their own data
  - Admins have controlled access to user data for support purposes

## Application Security

### Secure Development Practices

- **OWASP Top 10**: Mitigations for all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
- **Static Analysis**: Automated scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly by external security firm

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
  - 1000 requests per hour per user
  - 10 requests per minute for authentication endpoints
  
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Context-specific output encoding
- **CORS Policy**: Strict origin validation

### Frontend Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  ```
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' https://analytics.example.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https://images.pexels.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://your-project.supabase.co;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  ```

- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: For all third-party resources
- **XSS Protection**: Strict context-aware output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for all state-changing operations

## Infrastructure Security

### Hosting Security

- **Cloud Provider**: AWS with security best practices
- **Network Security**: 
  - VPC with private subnets
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - DDoS protection
  
- **Server Hardening**:
  - Minimal attack surface
  - Regular security patches
  - Principle of least privilege

### Database Security

- **Supabase Security**:
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
  - Regular security audits
  - Automated backups

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Monitoring systems identify potential incidents
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Document lessons learned

### Breach Notification Procedure

1. **Internal Notification**: Security team notified within 1 hour
2. **Assessment**: Impact and scope determined within 24 hours
3. **User Notification**: Affected users notified within 72 hours
4. **Regulatory Reporting**: Authorities notified as required by law

## Compliance

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR**: Full compliance for EU users
  - Data minimization
  - Purpose limitation
  - Lawful basis for processing
  - Data subject rights implementation
  
- **CCPA/CPRA**: Compliance for California users
  - Privacy policy
  - Right to delete
  - Right to know
  - Opt-out of sale

- **HIPAA**: Not currently applicable (not storing PHI)

### Privacy Measures

- **Privacy by Design**: Built into development process
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary information
- **Retention Limits**: Data deleted when no longer needed
- **User Control**: Self-service data export and deletion

## Security Testing

### Regular Testing Schedule

| Test Type | Frequency | Responsibility |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Vulnerability Scanning | Weekly | Security Team |
| Penetration Testing | Quarterly | External Vendor |
| Security Code Review | Every PR | Development Team |
| Dependency Audit | Daily | Automated CI/CD |
| Access Control Review | Monthly | Security Team |

### Security Testing Tools

- **Static Analysis**: ESLint with security plugins
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: OWASP ZAP, Nessus
- **Penetration Testing**: Burp Suite, Metasploit

## Backup & Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Database**: 
  - Daily full backups
  - Point-in-time recovery (PITR) for 7 days
  - Stored in multiple geographic regions
  
- **User Content**:
  - Redundant storage with versioning
  - Cross-region replication

### Recovery Procedures

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Quarterly
